Yoo, what's good gng
This is sth simple that I created for you gng

To set up your password, open the gui.py using your IDE then edit the code
between the 2nd block and the 4th one, you can easily see where you can edit it.
The original password is 'cyrus' without the apostrophes ofc.

yall have the permission to use this code to create better programs for yourselves
you can also fork it if you have to and even perform a pull request darling

thanks! better and more fancy tools to come inshaAllah !!
